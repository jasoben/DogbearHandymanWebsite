Dogbear Handyman Services is owned and operated by Jason Bennett. Jason has lived in the Charlottesville area since 1983, attending the local schools from Crozet Elementary up through UVA. When he isn't handyman-ing, Jason volunteers for the [Charlottesville Tool Library](https://cvilletoollibrary.com), the [Nelson County SPCA](https://nelsonspca.org/), mountain bikes, rock climbs, plays drums in the local band [Luchadora](https://soundcloud.com/vivaluchadora), and hangs out with the world's goofiest German Shepherd, the Dogbear herself. 

### Who is Dogbear?
Dogbear is Ursa the German Shepherd. Jason adopted Ursa in 2019 after finding her on Petfinder via the [Mary Ann Morris Animal Society (M.A.M.A.S. Foundation and Rescue)](https://www.maryannmorrisanimalsociety.org/) where her name was "Fantastic Fraulein". As an avid fan of astronomy and the local black bears who were frequent visitors at his rural childhood home, Jason knew her name had to be Ursa. 

While Jason is the brains of the operation, Ursa is its namesake as well as its chief canine diplomat.
